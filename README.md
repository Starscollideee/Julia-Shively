About Me :) 


My name is Julia! <br>My pronouns are she/her.<br> I am intetrested in library programming! I am currently running several monthly programs at the library where I work, including one on Bullet Journaling. I am also currently working on my MLIS at Drexel University! I have my BA in English with a Writing Concentration from Moravian University. I have two dogs, Jake and Luna!

I am also interested in learning more about [Mods for Stardew Valley](https://github.com/Pathoschild/StardewMods) and [Digital Bullet Journaling](https://github.com/bastianallgeier/bulletjournal)) if you want to check those out as well! I prefer a physical journal but there are always merits to accessability in different formats to anythine who wants to pick up Bullet journaling!
